This folder contains a game called RUN, a first-person racing game inspired by Mirror's Edge.

This game is a collaboration between several students at the university of Skövde, the group consisted of
9 people where 3 of them were programmers:
Ludwig Gustavsson - https://github.com/Arqu3
Agnar Óskarsson - https://github.com/ritli
Marcus Lundgren - https://github.com/dingofighter

The .rar archive contains a runnable .exe of the game, the project itself is avaliable at:
https://github.com/Arqu3/Project-R.U.N

Note: It's recommended to play the tutorial under level select to get a feeling for the game.
Thanks for playing!
