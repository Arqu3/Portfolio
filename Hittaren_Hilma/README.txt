This folder contains a 2D point and click adventure game made with C++ SFML during the "Spelprojekt 1" course
on the university of Skövde. This game is a collaboration of 15 students where 4 of them were programmers:

Ludwig Gustavsson - https://github.com/Arqu3
Marcus Lundgren - https://github.com/Dingofighter
Rebecca Romin - https://github.com/RebeccaRomin
Johan Synnergren - https://github.com/c0uTep

A trailer for the game can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt3fec63UPg

I worked as pseudo-lead programmer on this project where most of my work was focused on keeping all the other
programmers on the same track and designing and implementing systems, such as the inventory/crafting.

Due to the size of the project it is not directly avaliable in this repo, instead it can be downloaded here:

In the repo are some example classes that I've worked on in the project, they are written in C++ SFML.
